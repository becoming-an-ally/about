> “Anti-racism work is not self-improvement work for white people. It doesn’t end when white people feel better about what they’ve done. It ends when Black people are staying alive and they have their liberation.” — Rachel Cargle (<a href="https://twitter.com/RachelCargle">Twitter</a>; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachel.cargle/">Instagram</a>)

> “One of the challenges is, white people want to call people of color and say, ‘What am I supposed to do,’ which puts a tremendous burden on people of color,” __Carla Wallace, a co-founder of Showing Up for Racial Justice__, tells the Cut. “Our work is to move other white people.

> “__Unless we get more white people to end white silence, our silence will always be used by those in power to not make the changes that are needed. The majority of white people in this country are still on the side of business as usual__,” Wallace says. “If 10,000 white people showed up tomorrow on the steps of Louisville’s City Hall, you can bet the mayor would fire these police officers who killed Breonna Taylor. …We have to win a significant number to stand with black, brown, and indigenous communities for the justice that we all need in this country.”
